          A2ARoute defines how to route A2A (Agent-to-Agent) requests to backend A2A agents.

          This serves as a way to define a "unified" A2A API for a Gateway which allows downstream
          clients to use a single endpoint to interact with multiple A2A backend agents.

                    ParentReference identifies an API object (usually a Gateway) that can be considered
                    a parent of this resource (usually a route). There are two kinds of parent resources
                    with "Core" support:

                    * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                    * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                    This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent
                    resources.

                    The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
                    be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.

                        Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                        boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                        allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                        Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                        generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                        routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                        any namespace to the Service.

                        ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                        "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                        connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                        the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                        ParentRef of the Route.

                        When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                        networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                        as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                        and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                        must match both specified values.

                        When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the

                        long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                        namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                        from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                        attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                        the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                        are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                        Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.

                        For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at

                        listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
